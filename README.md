## Getting Started

First, running the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. (boilerplate)

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Additional dependencies 

I installed additional dependencies to make my project come to life

- npm install bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth
## Arranging the Folders
### New app folder
I deleted the app folder to start from complete scratch, then I created a new one in the root of the directory.
### components folder
I created another folder for my reuseable components, not in the app folder but in the root directory and call it components.
### models folder
Then I created another folder calls models. This is going to be for Mongodb Mongoose DB models.
### New public folder
I deleted the public folder and provided another new one.
### styles folder
I created an empty folder for styles.
### utils folder
I created another folder called utils for my utility functions that I'm going to use throughout my application 

### .env file
I created a file called .env for environment variables inside of which I can store secure keys

#### Before starting building my app 
I compiled a list of assets icons and styles this project will use, to make the development of the parts that really matter in this app easier. 
For this I updated the tailwind.config.js file, provided a CSS file named globals.css and also added assets folder to the public folder. assets folder contains icons and images.


### YAY Let's Start!
Now let's dive into the app directory and figure out how I want to start developing my application 

### add new file (page.jsx)
I added a new file within the app folder called page.jsx. It is that unique file that's going to render our homepage

####
In the page file I used rafce to create react arrow function and rename it with the name Home

### add layout file 
This is second important file that should be added. I called it layout.jsx and again with using rafce, I created react function. I didn't need to important react. I imported globals.css file. I didn't need to mention the entire path and just did 
#### import "@styles/globals.css";
Because of this I edited jsconfig.json file such as 

 "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@*": ["./*"]
    }
  }

This is going to import CSS to my entire application.
- I changed the metadata of my application.
- Finally I wrapped everything in an HTML tag and specified the language. I have a body tag and within the body, I have a div with a className main and within it I have another self-closed dig with the className gradient (This is just going to change the background) and finally I have another main tag with className app and within it we want to render all the children and I gave it through as a props so we get the children from that props.
As we know the layout will be wrapped around everything. 

- I renamed the layout too RootLayout also.
- Finally I just exported it.

### jsconfig.json

after updating the layout file I got the error Module not found: Can't resolve '@styles/globals.css'
So I had to go to jsconfig.json and update it by remove the / from @/*.

### Updating my Home Component in page.jsx to implement my homepage 
I try to update my Home Component in page.jsx file with semantic HTML that I need to use to develop the homepage of my application.
##### I shall use some specific classes in Tailwind 
### Note that Whenever we see underscore it means they came from my own styling in global.css 



## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
